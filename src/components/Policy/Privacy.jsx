            Security Practices
          </h3>
          <p>
            AxenCare employs a range of measures to protect the privacy and
            confidentiality of Personal Information. We primarily hold Personal
            Information in electronic form and take reasonable steps to ensure
            your Personal Information is protected from misuse and loss and from
            unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Online Platforms and systems are firewall protected.
            Additionally, the servers on which we store personal information are
            kept in a secure environment. Information in our data centres,
            including Personal Information, is encrypted in accordance with
            applicable laws. Further, we have implemented applicable industry
            standard security controls including PCI DSS that help us protect
            all our customer’s information in a highly secure manner. Also,
            Personal Information is destroyed or de-identified when no longer
            needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            No data transmission over the internet is fully secure, so we cannot
            ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Information you
            submit to us. Further, we do not guarantee in any way, the security
            of any Personal Information that you transmit or share on the Online
            Platforms. Accordingly, any Personal Information or other
            information which you transmit to us online is transmitted at your
            own risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any security breach comes to our knowledge, then we may take all
            steps required to protect misuse of such Information and may attempt
            to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
            protective steps.
